                        I named him Biscuit because when he was a kitten, 
                        he kept kneading everything like he was baking dough. 
                        Felt perfect.

                        He acts like he owns the house and rules over 
                        everyone, so Chairman Meow just fit too well.

                        She’s Waffles because she’s soft, warm, and you 
                        just want to squish her like comfort food.
