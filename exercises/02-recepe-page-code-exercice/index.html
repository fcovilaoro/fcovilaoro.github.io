        <h1>UYGHUR MEAT PIE</h1>
        
        <p>
            Uyghur meat pie, or Gosh Naan, is like a stuffed naan that's fried
            to crispy, flaky, and buttery perfection on the outside, while 
            the inside remains juicy and full of flavor. The rich fat from 
            the lamb soaks into the dough as it fries, creating an incredibly 
            satisfying texture and taste. Slice it into triangles and serve 
            with chili oil for an extra burst of heat, and you're in for one 
            of the most delicious experiences!
        </p>

        <h1>INSTRUCTION</h1>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Prepare the Dough:</b>
                In a large bowl, mix the flour, salt, and active dry yeast. 
                Gradually add the warm water and oil, stirring until the mixture 
                forms a dough. Knead the dough for about 5 to 6 minutes until 
                smooth and elastic. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and a damp 
                cloth and let it rest in a warm place for 1 hour or until it 
                doubles in size.

            <li>
                <b>Prepare the Filling:</b>
                In a separate bowl, combine the ground lamb, finely chopped 
                onion, salt, black pepper, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, and 
                chili powder. Mix everything together thoroughly. The filling 
                will remain raw and will cook during the frying process.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
                <b>Form the Naan:</b>
                Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into four 
                equal sections. Flatten each section into a circle or oval shape 
                on a lightly floured surface. Spread the lamb filling over two 
                the flattened dough sections, leaving a small border around the 
                edges. Take the other two flattened dough pieces and place them 
                on top of the filled ones, covering the meat mixture. Press down 
                lightly to seal.
            </li>
            
            <br>

            <li>
                <b>Pinched Design:</b>
                Carefully fold the edges of the dough over the filling, creating 
                a pinched design like a pie crust. Make sure to seal the sides 
                tightly so the filling doesnâ€™t escape during frying.
            </li>
            
            <br>

            <li>
                <b>Fry and Naan:</b>
                Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan or skillet over medium-high 
                heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully lower the stuffed naan into 
                the oil. Fry on both sides for about 3-4 minutes per side, or 
                until golden brown and crispy. Ensure the meat is cooked through 
                and the center is fully cooked.
            </li>
            
            <br>

            <li>
                <b>Slice and Serve:</b>
                Once fried, remove the naans from the oil and drain on paper 
                towels. Slice into triangles, like a pizza, and serve warm. 
                For an extra kick, drizzle with chili oil on top and enjoy!
