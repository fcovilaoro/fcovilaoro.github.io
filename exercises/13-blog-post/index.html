                    Cats have a reputation for being graceful, intelligent, 
                    andâ€”letâ€™s be honestâ€”a little mischievous. If you live 
                    with one, youâ€™ve probably witnessed the classic moment: 
                    your cat stares intently at a glass, a pen, or maybe 
                    even your phoneâ€¦ then with one quick paw swipe, down 
                    it goes. While it may seem like cats are just trying 
                    to cause chaos, there are actually fascinating 
                    easons behind this behavior.

                    Cats are natural hunters. In the wild, small 
                    movementsâ€”like a mouse rustling in the grassâ€”catch 
                    their attention. Knocking objects over may simply 
                    be their way of testing whether something is alive. 
                    A pen rolling across the floor? In their mind, t
                    hatâ€™s prey in motion.
