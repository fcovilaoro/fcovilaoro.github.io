        <h1>The Show Unfolds</h1>

        <p>
            The runway comes alive with movement. Models storm forward in 
            heavy fabrics, futuristic silhouettes, and exaggerated shapes. 
            Screens project images of collapsing cities and rising oceans, 
            the collectxion a reflection of chaos and resilience. The crowd is 
            silent, entranced. You realize you are merely a spectator—or 
            perhaps you could change that.
