        <h1>The Front Row</h1>

        <p>
            The lights dim as you sink into your front-row seat. Celebrities 
            lean into whispered conversations while cameras flash endlessly. 
            Suddenly, a well-known fashion critic recognizes you and smirks, 
            as if daring you to make your mark. The first model appears in 
            blinding white light.
