        <h1>The Forbidden Look</h1>

        <p>
            Curiosity wins. You slide into the couture piece, its weight both 
            suffocating and empowering. Mirrors reflect a figure you barely 
            recognize—sharp, sculpted, commanding. Before you can react, a 
            stylist gasps. “You—get to the runway. Now.” With no time to 
            argue, you’re pushed toward the blinding lights.
        </p>
