        <h1>The Forbidden Look</h1>

        <p>
            Curiosity wins. You slide into the couture piece, its weight both 
            suffocating and empowering. Mirrors reflect a figure you barely 
            recognize‚Äîsharp, sculpted, commanding. Before you can react, a 
            stylist gasps. ‚ÄúYou‚Äîget to the runway. Now.‚Äù With no time to 
            argue, you‚Äôre pushed toward the blinding lights.
        </p>
